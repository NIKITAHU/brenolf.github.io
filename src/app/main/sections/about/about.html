    Hello, my name is Breno Lima de Freitas. I'm a {{vm.age}} years old computer scientist based at Indaiatuba, Brazil. I've always loved playing out with computers and trying to make them do some tricks under my command; maybe that's why I ended up pursuing a career on computer science (take a look at <a class="about__text__link" ui-sref="cv">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>).

    <br/><br/>

    My areas of interest are many, but I'm mainly passionate about theoritical computer science and artificial intelligence; Machine Learning being my major topic of study. I look forward to working with you to build something great and have an enjoyable time!

    Hello, my name is Breno Freitas!

    <br/><br/>

    I'm a {{vm.age}} years old brazilian computer scientist based at Ottawa, Canada. I've always loved playing out with computers and trying to make them do some tricks under my command; that's why I ended up pursuing a career on computer science (take a look at <a class="about__text__link" href="/assets/pdf/cv.pdf">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>).

    <br/><br/>

    My areas of interest are many, but I'm mainly passionate about theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence; Machine Learning being my major topic of study. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a> making merchants' lives better!
